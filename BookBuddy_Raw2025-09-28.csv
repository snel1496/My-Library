Aesop's Fables,,,,,Aesop,Aesop,,,,,,Canterbury Classics,San Diego,2013/10/15,2013,,,,Fiction,"A collection of charming and enduring stories that convey morals to young and old alike.Aesop was a slave and storyteller who lived in ancient Greece around 620–564 BCE. No writings by him exist (if they ever existed at all), yet numerous stories and tales have been credited to him and have been shared through oral tradition throughout the world.  Many of these use animals as the main characters to convey deeper meanings and morals that have become ingrained in our cultural—and personal—belief systems. For example, in “The Goatherd and the Goat” we learn that there is no use trying to hide what can’t be hidden. In “The Ass and the Purchaser” we find that people are known by the company they keep. In “The Boys and the Frogs,” one person’s pleasure may be another person’s pain. “The Dogs and the Fox” show how easy it is to kick a man when he’s down. And misery loves company, as we see in “The Fox Without a Tail.” Aesop’s Fables has been one of the world’s most charming collections of stories that have influenced thousands of other literary works. About the Word Cloud Classics series:Classic works of literature with a clean, modern aesthetic! Perfect for both old and new literature fans, the Word Cloud Classics series from Canterbury Classics provides a chic and inexpensive introduction to timeless tales.

There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he'll enroll in Oxford University's prestigious Royal Institute of Translation--also known as Babel.

Beowulf,,A New Verse Translation,,,Seamus Heaney,"Heaney, Seamus",,,,,,W. W. Norton & Company,,,2001,,,,Poetry,"Composed toward the end of the first millennium of our era, Beowulf is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of Beowulf, a Scandinavian hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and, later, from Grendel's mother. He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the end of the twentieth century, Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface. Drawn to what he has called the ""four-squareness of the utterance"" in Beowulf and its immense emotional credibility, Heaney gives these epic qualities new and convincing reality for the contemporary reader.--Book jacket.",,,,,,,,,,,213,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780393320978,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/14 09:32:46.755980014,,,,,,,,m-7crEM3A0AC,,0,0,0,,,

Cannery Row,,,,,John Steinbeck,"Steinbeck, John",,,,,,Penguin,"New York, N.Y., U.S.A",1994/02/01,1994,,,,Fiction,"Steinbeck’s tough yet charming portrait of people on the margins of society, dependant on one another for both physical and emotional survivalA Penguin Classic Published in 1945, Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as it is: both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual. Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: “Scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed . . . and, at the darkest level . . . the terror of isolation and nothingness.”For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Different,,Gender Through the Eyes of a Primatologist,,,Frans de Waal,"Waal, Frans de",,,,,,National Geographic Books,"New York, NY",2022/04/05,2022,,,,Science,"“Every new book by Frans de Waal is a cause for excitement, and this one is no different. A breath of fresh air in the cramped debate about the differences between men and women. Fascinating, nuanced, and very timely.” —Rutger Bregman, author of Humankind: A Hopeful History In Different, world-renowned primatologist Frans de Waal draws on decades of observation and studies of both human and animal behavior to argue that despite the linkage between gender and biological sex, biology does not automatically support the traditional gender roles in human societies. While humans and other primates do share some behavioral differences, biology offers no justification for existing gender inequalities. Using chimpanzees and bonobos to illustrate this point—two ape relatives that are genetically equally close to humans—de Waal challenges widely held beliefs about masculinity and femininity, and common assumptions about authority, leadership, cooperation, competition, filial bonds, and sexual behavior. Chimpanzees are male-dominated and violent, while bonobos are female-dominated and peaceful. In both species, political power needs to be distinguished from physical dominance. Power is not limited to the males, and both sexes show true leadership capacities. Different is a fresh and thought-provoking approach to the long-running debate about the balance between nature and nurture, and where sex and gender roles fit in. De Waal peppers his discussion with details from his own life—a Dutch childhood in a family of six boys, his marriage to a French woman with a different orientation toward gender, and decades of academic turf wars over outdated scientific theories that have proven hard to dislodge from public discourse. He discusses sexual orientation, gender identity, and the limitations of the gender binary, exceptions to which are also found in other primates. With humor, clarity, and compassion, Different seeks to broaden the conversation about human gender dynamics by promoting an inclusive model that embraces differences, rather than negating them.",,,,,,,,,,,400,,,6.34 x 1.30 x 9.84 in,,,English,,612.6,,,,9781324007104,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/04/09 16:09:37.952453017,,,,,,,,YGqPEAAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god. But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight ArchiveThe Way of KingsWords of RadianceEdgedancer (Novella)Oathbringer The Mistborn trilogyMistborn: The Final EmpireThe Well of AscensionThe Hero of AgesMistborn: The Wax and Wayne seriesAlloy of LawShadows of SelfBands of MourningCollectionArcanum UnboundedOther Cosmere novelsElantrisWarbreakerThe Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians seriesAlcatraz vs. the Evil LibrariansThe Scrivener's BonesThe Knights of CrystalliaThe Shattered LensThe Dark TalentThe Rithmatist seriesThe RithmatistOther books by Brandon SandersonThe ReckonersSteelheartFirefightCalamity",,,,,,,,,,,656,,,4.21 x 1.06 x 6.69 in,,,English,,,,,,9780765350374,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/19 15:15:15.946609973,,,,,,,,BwLtmAEACAAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Erasing History,,How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future,,,Jason Stanley,"Stanley, Jason",,,,,,Simon and Schuster,New York,2024/09/10,2024,,,,History,"""I've never read a book that is as timely, urgent and essential as this one. A battle plan for keeping this nation from falling into fascism."" --Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of The Condemnation of Blackness From the bestselling author of How Fascism Works, a searing confrontation with the far right's efforts to rewrite history and undo a century of progress on race, gender, sexuality, and class. The human race finds itself again under threat of a rising global fascist movement. In the United States, democracy is under attack by an authoritarian movement that has found fertile ground among the country's conservative politicians and voters, but similar movements have found homes in the hearts and minds of people all across the globe. To understand the shape, form, and stakes of this assault, we must go back to extract lessons from our past. Democracy requires a common understanding of reality, a shared view of what has happened, that informs ordinary citizens' decisions about what should happen, now and in the future. Authoritarians target this shared understanding, seeking to separate us from our own history to destroy our self-understanding and leave us unmoored, resentful, and confused. By setting us against each other, authoritarians represent themselves as the sole solution. In authoritarian countries, critical examination of those nations' history and traditions is discouraged if not an outright danger to those who do it. And it is no accident that local and global institutions of education have become a battleground, the authoritarian right's tip of the spear, where learning and efforts to upend a hierarchal status quo can be put to end by coercion and threats of violence. Democracies entrust schools and universities to preserve a common memory of positive change, generated by protests, social movements, and rebellions. The authoritarian right must erase this history, and, along with it, the very practice of critical inquiry that has so often been the engine of future progress. In Erasing History, Yale professor of philosophy Jason Stanley exposes the true danger of the authoritarian right's attacks on education, identifies their key tactics and funders, and traces their intellectual roots. He illustrates how fears of a fascist future have metastasized, from hypothetical threat to present reality. And he shows that hearts and minds are won in our schools and universities--places, he explains, that democratic societies across the world are now ill-prepared to defend against the fascist assault currently underway. Deeply informed and urgently needed, Erasing History is a global call to action for those who wish to preserve democracy--in America and abroad--before it is too late.",,,,,,,,,,,256,,,5.51 x 1.18 x 8.39 in,,,English,,320.533,,,,9781668056912,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/14 11:24:30.162459969,,,,,,,,DJAZEQAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,

When he awoke after his long sleep, he didn’t know much more than his name. His brain-fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight. Somehow Percy managed to make it to the camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he had to continually kill monsters that, annoyingly, would not stay dead. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him.Hazel is supposed to be dead. When she lived before, she didn’t do a very good job of it. When the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her “gift” for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn’t say no. Now, because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Frank is a klutz. His grandmother claims he is descended from ancient heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn’t see it. He doesn’t even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to help the Fifth Cohort win at war games. His big and bulky physique makes him feel like a clumsy ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough, even, to share the secret he holds close to his heart. Beginning at the “other” camp for half-bloods and extending as far north as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment in the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all of whom are destined to play a part in the most important quest of all: the Prophecy of Seven.",,,,,,,,,,,544,,,,,,English,,[Fic],,,,9781423140597,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/14 11:24:30.151679039,,,,,,,,02oZzQEACAAJ,,0,0,0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13011807-L.jpg,

A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life. Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income. In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants. Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.",,,,,,,,,,,304,,,5.98 x 1.30 x 9.45 in,,14.99 $,English,,791.4502/8092 B,,,,9781982185824,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/14 10:48:38.589521050,,,,,,,,13mAEAAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Marble Woman: Unknown Th,,unknown thrillers of Louisa May Alcott,,,"L Alcott,Madeline B. Stern","Alcott, L",,,,,,HarperCollins,New York,1995/09/01,1995,,,,Fiction,"Six years before she wrote Little Women, and in financial straits, Louisa May Alcott entered Pauline's Passion and Punishment, a novelette, in a newspaper contest. Not only did it win the $100 prize, but, published anonymously, it marked the first of the series of blood & thunder tales that would provide her livelihood for years. For as she said, They are easy to 'compoze' & are better paid than moral...works. The gruesome, passionate stories reveal a darker side of Alcott. Published anonymously or under the pseudonym of A. M. Barnard, they appeared in weeklies over a century ago. In their mastery of suspense and psychological drama, and in their embodiment of a startlingly intense - if oblique - feminism, they attest to the multifaceted genius of their creator.

Medea,,A Novel,,,Eilish Quin,"Quin, Eilish",,,,,,Simon and Schuster,New York,2024/02/13,2024,,,,Fiction,"Discover the full story of the sorceress Medea, one of the most reviled and maligned women of Greek antiquity, in this “haunting, deeply moving” (Claire Legrand, New York Times bestselling author) debut in the tradition of Circe, Elektra, and Stone Blind.Among the women of Greek mythology, the witch Medea may be the most despised. Known for the brutal act of killing her own children to exact vengeance on her deceitful husband, Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, Medea has carved out a singularly infamous niche in our histories. But what if that isn’t the full story? The daughter of a sea nymph and the granddaughter of a Titan, Medea is a paradox. She is at once rendered compelling by virtue of the divinity that flows through her bloodline and made powerless by the fact of her being a woman. As a child, she intuitively submerges herself in witchcraft and sorcery but soon finds her skills may not be a match for the prophecies that hang over her entire family like a shroud. As Medea comes into her own as a woman and a witch, she also faces the arrival of the hero Jason, preordained by the gods to be not only her husband but also her lifeline to escape her isolated existence. Medea travels the treacherous seas with the Argonauts, battles demons she has never imagined, and falls in love with the man who may ultimately be her downfall in this fresh and propulsive “must-have” (Library Journal, starred review) read in which you will finally hear Medea’s side of the story through a fresh and feminist lens.",,,,,,,,,,,304,,,5.98 x 0.98 x 9.02 in,,,English,,813/.6,,,,9781668020760,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/07/26 15:21:46.871122956,,,,,,,,dpruEAAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Programming the Universe,,A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes on the Cosmos,,,Seth Lloyd,"Lloyd, Seth",,,,,,Knopf,"New York, NY, USA",,2006,,,,Computers,"Is the universe actually a giant quantum computer? According to Seth Lloyd--Professor of Quantum-Mechanical Engineering at MIT and originator of the first technologically feasible design for a working quantum computer--the answer is yes. This wonderfully accessible book illuminates the professional and personal paths that led him to this remarkable conclusion. All interactions between particles in the universe, Lloyd explains, convey not only energy but also information--in other words, particles not only collide, they compute. And what is the entire universe computing, ultimately? ""Its own dynamical evolution,"" he says. ""As the computation proceeds, reality unfolds."" To elucidate his theory, Lloyd examines the history of the cosmos, posing questions that in other hands might seem unfathomably complex: How much information is there in the universe? What information existed at the moment of the Big Bang and what happened to it? How do quantum mechanics and chaos theory interact to create our world?

Queer Silence,,On Disability and Rhetorical Absence,,,J. Logan Smilges,"Smilges, J. Logan",,,,,,University of Minnesota Press,,,2022,,,,Social Science,"Championing the liberatory potential of silence to address the fraught disability politics of queerness In queer culture, silence has been equated with voicelessness, complicity, and even death. Queer Silence insists, however, that silence can be a generative and empowering mode of survival. Triangulating insights from queer studies, disability studies, and rhetorical studies, J. Logan Smilges explores what silence can mean for people whose bodyminds signify more powerfully than their words. Queer Silence begins by historicizing silence's negative reputation, beginning with the ways homophile activists rejected medical models pathologizing homosexuality as a disability, resulting in the silencing of disability itself. This silencing was redoubled by HIV/AIDS activism's demand for ""out, loud, and proud"" rhetorical activities that saw silence as capitulation. Reading a range of cultural artifacts whose relative silence has failed to attract queer attachment, from anonymous profiles on Grindr to ex-gays to belated gender transitions to disability performance art, Smilges argues for silence's critical role in serving the needs of queers who are never named as such. Queer Silence urges queer activists and queer studies scholars to reconcile with their own ableism by acknowledging the liberatory potential of silence, a mode of engagement that disattached queers use every day for resistance, sociality, and survival.

In Rooted, cutting-edge science supports a truth that poets, artists, mystics, and earth-based cultures across the world have proclaimed over millennia: life on this planet is radically interconnected. Our bodies, thoughts, minds, and spirits are affected by the whole of nature, and they affect this whole in return. In this time of crisis, how can we best live upon our imperiled, beloved earth?  Award-winning writer Lyanda Lynn Haupt's highly personal new book is a brilliant invitation to live with the earth in both simple and profound ways--from walking barefoot in the woods and reimagining our relationship with animals and trees, to examining the very language we use to describe and think about nature. She invokes rootedness as a way of being in concert with the wilderness--and wildness--that sustains humans and all of life.  In the tradition of Rachel Carson, Elizabeth Kolbert, and Mary Oliver, Haupt writes with urgency and grace, reminding us that at the crossroads of science, nature, and spirit we find true hope.

The Fairy Bargains of Prospect Hill,,,,,Rowenna Miller,"Miller, Rowenna",,,,,,Orbit,"New York, NY",,2023,,,,Fiction,"""A warm-hearted yet fierce fairy tale.""―H. G. Parry    In the early 1900s, two sisters must navigate the magic and the dangers of the Fae in this enchanting and cozy historical fantasy about sisterhood and self-discovery.    There is no magic on Prospect Hill--or anywhere else, for that matter. But just on the other side of the veil is the world of the Fae. Generations ago, the first farmers on Prospect Hill learned to bargain small trades to make their lives a little easier--a bit of glass to find something lost, a cup of milk for better layers in the chicken coop.    Much of that old wisdom was lost as the riverboats gave way to the rail lines and the farmers took work at mills and factories. Alaine Fairborn's family, however, was always superstitious, and she still hums the rhymes to find a lost shoe and to ensure dry weather on her sister's wedding day.    When Delphine confides her new husband is not the man she thought he was, Alaine will stop at nothing to help her sister escape him. Small bargains buy them time, but a major one is needed. Yet, the price for true freedom may be more than they're willing to pay.    Praise for The Fairy Bargains of Prospect Hill:    ""Brimming with folk magic and delightfully sinister hidden worlds.

The Flowers of Evil,,,,,Charles Baudelaire,"Baudelaire, Charles",,,,,,New Directions Publishing,New York,,1989,,,,Literary Criticism,"Banned and slighted in his lifetime, the book that contains all of Baudelaire's verses has opened up vistas to the imagination and quickened sensibilities of poets everywhere. Yet it is questionable whether a single translator can give adequate voice to Baudelaire's full poetic range.

It's just a matter of finding it.Seventeen-year-old Ian Wilder's heart belonged to one person-his next-door neighbor, bestie, and steady girlfriend, Penelope Archer. To him, their hearts matched like the last two puzzle pieces across an infinite jigsaw universe. Since grade school, they spent every free moment in the outgrown treehouse adjoining their yards. There, under the dull glow of dying flashlights, Ian scribbled the words, and Penelope painted the worlds from their imagination. From western shootouts with kooky outlaws or surviving a horde of alien zombies aboard a space station, their stories poured to the pages more vividly than suburban reality. But junior year hit harder. Their stories took a back seat to make out sessions under the sleeping bags of that old treehouse. And as these two puzzle pieces came closer to completing the universe, something changed. Tragedy struck. Unable to cope, Ian cracked and succumbed to a walking state of catatonia. When Ian finally returned to school, a strange substitute teacher cornered him to tell Ian that infinite realities exist across a multiverse. Stranger yet, the substitute teacher desperately needed Ian's help to prevent a similar tragedy in an alternate reality filled with blood-thirsty pirates. Did Ian finally lose his mind? Or had he let his ridiculous imagination take over for him? Either way, he didn't care. It was an adventure, and if this was the last sign of his sanity slip away, so be it.Would Ian be able to solve his problems with the multiverse at his fingertips?

The God Delusion,,,,,Richard Dawkins,"Dawkins, Richard",,,,,,Houghton Mifflin Company,Boston,,2006,,,,Religion,"A preeminent scientist -- and the world's most prominent atheist -- asserts the irrationality of belief in God and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11.  With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.",,,,,,,,,,,463,,,5.51 x 1.22 x 8.27 in,,,English,,,,,,9780618918249,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/04/09 16:09:37.931563019,,,,,,,,OYpHYgEACAAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Her giants have risen-all of them-and they're stronger than ever.  They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens.  She needs their blood-the blood of Olympus-in order to wake.   The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood.  The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance.  Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps.   The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.  The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless.  How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea's army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option.  They have sacrificed too much already.  And if Gaea wakes, it is game over.

The Iliad,,,,,Homer,Homer,,,,,,Penguin,New York,1991/07/01,1991,,,,Poetry,"The great war epic of Western literature, in a stunning translation by acclaimed classicist Robert FaglesA Penguin ClassicDating to the ninth century B.C., Homer’s timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to the wrenching, tragic conclusion of the Trojan War. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The Jane Austen Book Club,,,,,Karen Joy Fowler,"Fowler, Karen Joy",,,,,,Putnam,New York,,2004,,,,Fiction,"A sublime comedy of contemporary manners, this is the novel Jane Austen might well have written had she lived in twenty-first- century California.  Nothing ever moves in a straight line in Karen Joy Fowler's fiction, and in her latest, the complex dance of modern love has never been so devious or so much fun.  Six Californians join to discuss Jane Austen's novels. Over the six months they meet, marriages are tested, affairs begin, unsuitable arrangements become suitable, and love happens. With her finely sighted eye for the frailties of human behavior and her finely tuned ear for the absurdities of social intercourse, Fowler has never been wittier nor her characters more appealing. The result is a delicious dissection of modern relationships.  Dedicated Austenites will delight in unearthing the echoes of Austen that run through the novel, but most readers will simply enjoy the vision and voice that, despite two centuries of separation, unite two great writers of brilliant social comedy.",,,,,,,,,,,288,,,5.75 x 1.10 x 8.66 in,,,English,,813/.54,,,,9780399151613,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/04/09 16:26:06.759461998,,,,,,,,ObRaAAAAMAAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Nature.  Bea's five-year-old daughter, Agnes, is slowly wasting away, consumed by the smog and pollution of the overdeveloped metropolis that most of the population now calls home. If they stay in the city, Agnes will die. There is only one alternative: the Wilderness State, the last swath of untouched, protected land, where people have always been forbidden. Until now.  Bea, Agnes, and eighteen others volunteer to live in the Wilderness State, guinea pigs in an experiment to see if humans can exist in nature without destroying it. Living as nomadic hunter-gatherers, they slowly and painfully learn to survive in an unpredictable, dangerous land, bickering and battling for power and control as they betray and save one another. But as Agnes embraces the wild freedom of this new existence, Bea realizes that saving her daughter's life means losing her in a different way. The farther they get from civilization, the more their bond is tested in astonishing and heartbreaking ways.

The Uncoupling,,,,,Meg Wolitzer,"Wolitzer, Meg",,,,,,Riverhead Books,New York,,2011,,,,Desire,"From the New York Times-bestselling author of The Interestings and The Female Persuasion, a funny, provocative, revealing novel about female desire.   When the elliptical new drama teacher at Stellar Plains High School chooses for the school play Lysistrata-the comedy by Aristophanes in which women stop having sex with men in order to end a war-a strange spell seems to be cast over the school. Or, at least, over the women. One by one throughout the high school community, perfectly healthy, normal women and teenage girls turn away from their husbands and boyfriends in the bedroom, for reasons they don't really understand. As the women worry over their loss of passion, and the men become by turns unhappy, offended, and above all, confused, both sides are forced to look at their shared history, and at their sexual selves in a new light.  As she did to such acclaim with the New York Times bestseller The Ten-Year Nap, Wolitzer tackles an issue that has deep ramifications for women's lives, in a way that makes it funny, riveting, and totally fresh-allowing us to see our own lives through her insightful lens.Read an essay about writing The Uncoupling from the author, Meg Wolitzer.",,,,,,,,,,,271,,,,,12.99 $,English,,813/.54,,,,9781594487880,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/14 10:54:26.079458951,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6716815-L.jpg,

When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known. So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the Deep South to dangerously idealistic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures. This is the dramatic story of an atrocity inflicted on generations of women, men, and children—the violent and capricious separation of families—and the war they waged to simply make lives with the people they loved. Written by one of today’s most exciting thinkers and writers, The Water Dancer is a propulsive, transcendent work that restores the humanity of those from whom everything was stolen.Praise for The Water Dancer“Ta-Nehisi Coates is the most important essayist in a generation and a writer who changed the national political conversation about race with his 2015 memoir, Between the World and Me. So naturally his debut novel comes with slightly unrealistic expectations—and then proceeds to exceed them. The Water Dancer . . . is a work of both staggering imagination and rich historical significance. . . . What’s most powerful is the way Coates enlists his notions of the fantastic, as well as his fluid prose, to probe a wound that never seems to heal. . . .

The Way of Kings,,Book One of the Stormlight Archive,,,Brandon Sanderson,"Sanderson, Brandon",,,,,,Tor,New York,2010/08/31,2010,,,,New York Times Bestseller,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

I tell them I was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and that good fortune alone has led to my acceptance into their most prestigious school. I tell them that once I graduate, I will gladly join the rest of civilised society in allowing my strength, my drive and my focus—what they call Will—to be leeched away and added to the power of those above me, as millions already do. As all must eventually do. I tell them that I belong, and they believe me. But the truth is that I have been sent to the Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart. And that I will never, ever cede my Will to the empire that executed my family. To survive, though, I will still have to rise through the Academy’s ranks. I will have to smile, and make friends, and pretend to be one of them and win.

Ueli Steck,,My Life in Climbing,,,"Ueli Steck,Karin Steinbach","Steck, Ueli",,,,,,Mountaineers Books,"Seattle, Washington",,2018,,,,Biography & Autobiography,"Steck was considered by many to be one of the strongest climbers who ever lived The holder of six amazing speed-climbing records The first and only English-language book by this much loved alpinist  A climber of incredible strength, Ueli Steck set climbing records for speed and endurance that no one had previously thought possible. This deeply personal and revealing memoir,Ueli Steck: My Life in Climbing, is the only one of his books to be published in English.  In 2016, Ueli established a new speed record on Eiger's North Face--beating his own record! That same year he climbed all 82 four-thousand-meter peaks in the Alps within 62 days (traveling between the peaks by bicycle), and summited Annapurna's south face in 28 hours. But the dramatic events of the previous two years--the internationally reported conflict with Sherpas at Mount Everest, and the discovery of Alex Lowe's body on Shishapangma--changed him and made him rethink his approach to the mountains.  After withdrawing from the sport for a period, Ueli rediscovered his love of climbing, and in this memoir he explains how his perspective changed. While his drive to achieve in the mountains hadn't diminished, an evaluation of his experiences helped him find a new way to process the emotional and mental challenges that shaped his athletic outlook. Structured around key climbs,Ueli Steck: My Life in Climbing provides the history of each mountain and route, Ueli's reasons for attempting it, what happened on each climb itself, and what he learned from the experience. It also includes some fascinating insights into his training regimen.  Ueli infuses his story with the joy and freedom of climbing and running. He is honest, direct and, at times, exhibits the self-absorption common to many elite athletes. Ultimately, however, his experiences brought him to a place of self-awareness and he was no longer the same climber who first set the speed record on the Eiger's North Face. Ueli was determined that he would take only acceptable risks. Unfortunately, Ueli's bar for risk was still very high--he died while on a training climb on the Himalayan peak Nuptse on April 30, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,224,,,5.51 x 0.63 x 8.66 in,,,English,,796.522092 B,,,,9781680511321,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/04/09 15:54:56.445994973,,,,,,,,rP9ftAEACAAJ,,0,0,0,,,

After witnessing the death of her mother, the grief-stricken Pampa Kampana becomes a vessel for a goddess, who begins to speak out of the girl’s mouth. Granting her powers beyond Pampa Kampana’s comprehension, the goddess tells her that she will be instrumental in the rise of a great city called Bisnaga—“victory city”—the wonder of the world.Over the next 250 years, Pampa Kampana’s life becomes deeply interwoven with Bisnaga’s, from its literal sowing from a bag of magic seeds to its tragic ruination in the most human of ways: the hubris of those in power. Whispering Bisnaga and its citizens into existence, Pampa Kampana attempts to make good on the task that the goddess set for her: to give women equal agency in a patriarchal world. But all stories have a way of getting away from their creator, and Bisnaga is no exception. As years pass, rulers come and go, battles are won and lost, and allegiances shift, the very fabric of Bisnaga becomes an ever more complex tapestry—with Pampa Kampana at its center.Brilliantly styled as a translation of an ancient epic, Victory City is a saga of love, adventure, and myth that is in itself a testament to the power of storytelling.",,,,,,,,,,,352,,,6.38 x 1.14 x 9.84 in,,12.99 $,English,,823/.914—dc23,,,,9780593243398,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/04/09 15:57:40.084146022,,,,,,,,b9B6EAAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,

Was it their choice? What will become of those left behind? Why did Alex’s beloved aunt Marla transform but her mother did not? Alex doesn’t know.

Whole Brain Living,,The Anatomy of Choice and the Four Characters That Drive Our Life,,,PhD Jill Bolte Taylor,"Taylor, PhD Jill Bolte",,,,,,"Hay House, Inc","Carlsbad, California",2021/05/11,2021,,,,Self-Help,"The New York Times best-selling author of My Stroke of Insight blends neuroanatomy with psychology to show how we can short-circuit emotional reactivity and find our way to peace.For half a century we have been trained to believe that our right brain hemisphere is our emotional brain, while our left brain houses our rational thinking. Now neuroscience shows that it's not that simple: in fact, our emotional limbic tissue is evenly divided between our two hemispheres. Consequently, each hemisphere has both an emotional brain and a thinking brain. In this groundbreaking new book, Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor presents these four distinct modules of cells as four characters that make up who we are: Character 1, Left Thinking; Character 2, Left Emotion; Character 3, Right Emotion; and Character 4, Right Thinking.Everything we think, feel, or do is dependent upon brain cells to perform that function. Since each of the Four Characters stems from specific groups of cells that feel unique inside of our body, they each display particular skills, feel specific emotions, or think distinctive thoughts. In Whole Brain Living, Dr. Taylor shows us how to get acquainted with our own Four Characters, observe how they show up in our daily life, and learn to identify and relate to them in others as well. And she introduces a practice called the Brain Huddle--a tool for bringing our Four Characters into conversation with one another so we can tap their respective strengths and choose which one to embody in any situation.The more we become familiar with each of the characters in ourselves and others, the more power we gain over our thoughts, our feelings, our relationships, and our lives. Indeed, we discover that we have the power to choose who and how we want to be in every moment. And when our Four Characters work together and balance one another as a whole brain, we gain a radical new road map to deep inner peace.",,,,,,,,,,,304,,,6.38 x 0.98 x 9.29 in,,,English,,612.8/2,,,,9781401961985,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/04/09 16:26:06.762573003,,,,,,,,HfsoEAAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,

The campaign launched by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Civil Rights movement on the segregated streets of Birmingham demonstrated to the world the power of nonviolent direct action. In this remarkable book—winner of the Nobel Peace Prize—Dr. King recounts the story of Birmingham in vivid detail, tracing the history of the struggle for civil rights back to its beginnings three centuries ago and looking to the future, assessing the work to be done beyond Birmingham to bring about full equality for African Americans. Above all, Dr. King offers an eloquent and penetrating analysis of the events and pressures that propelled the Civil Rights movement from lunch counter sit-ins and prayer marches to the forefront of American consciousness.Since its publication in the 1960s, Why We Can’t Wait has become an indisputable classic.

Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight Archive● The Way of Kings● Words of Radiance● Edgedancer (novella)● Oathbringer● Dawnshard (novella)● Rhythm of WarThe Mistborn SagaThe Original Trilogy● Mistborn● The Well of Ascension● The Hero of AgesWax and Wayne● The Alloy of Law● Shadows of Self● The Bands of Mourning● The Lost MetalOther Cosmere novels● Elantris● Warbreaker● Tress of the Emerald Sea● Yumi and the Nightmare Painter● The Sunlit ManCollection● Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere CollectionThe Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series● Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians● The Scrivener's Bones● The Knights of Crystallia● The Shattered Lens● The Dark Talent● Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians (with Janci Patterson)Other novels● The Rithmatist● Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds● The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval EnglandOther books by Brandon SandersonThe Reckoners● Steelheart● Firefight● CalamitySkyward● Skyward● Starsight● Cytonic● Skyward Flight (with Janci Patterson)● Defiant",,,,,,,,,,,1087,,,6.73 x 2.09 x 9.84 in,,12.99 $,English,,813/.6,,,,9780765326362,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/03/14 10:47:18.922549962,,,,,,,,cZbQAgAAQBAJ,,0,0,0,,,
Wuthering Heights,,,,,Emily Bronte,"Bronte, Emily",,,,,,Penguin,London,2002/12/31,2002,,,,Fiction,"One of English literature's classic masterpieces—a gripping novel of love, propriety, and tragedy. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American ReadEmily Brontë's only novel endures as a work of tremendous and far-reaching influence.

There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before. What unfolds is the tale of the intense love between the gypsy foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw.

As Heathcliff's bitterness and vengeance at his betrayal is visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past.  In this edition, a new preface by Lucasta Miller, author of The Brontë Myth, looks at the ways in which the novel has been interpreted, from Charlotte Brontë onwards.

Yellowface,,A Novel,,,Rebecca F. Kuang,"Kuang, Rebecca F.",,,,,,HarperCollins Publishers,"New York, NY",,2023,,,,Fiction,"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK ""Hard to put down, harder to forget."" -- Stephen King, #1 New York Times bestselling author White lies. Dark humor. Deadly consequences... Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn't write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American--in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel.  Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena's a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks. So when June witnesses Athena's death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena's just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I. So what if June edits Athena's novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song--complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn't this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That's what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree. But June can't get away from Athena's shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June's (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves. With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang's novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.",,,,,,,,,,,323,,,5.98 x 1.10 x 9.45 in,,14.99 $,English,,813.6,,,,9780063250833,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2025/06/09 17:30:51.308431982,,,,,,,,ue5UzwEACAAJ,,0,0,0,,,
